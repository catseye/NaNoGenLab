Hypothesis
----------

We hypothesize that a novel, under the right circumstances, can evaporate.

Apparatus
---------

*   Python 2.7.6 (probably works with older versions too)
*   An input text â€” possibly a [pre-cleaned](../guten-gutter) text file
    previously downloaded from Project Gutenberg

Method
------

*   Collect all the sentences and count them: _s_ is the number of sentences.
*   In each sentence, erase words.  The probability of a word being erased
    is _n_/_s_ where _n_ is the sentence number;.the first sentence is
    numbered 0.
