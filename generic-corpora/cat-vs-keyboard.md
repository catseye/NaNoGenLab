Cat vs. Keyboard
================

Sometimes my cat mistakes my laptop for a warm, flat rock, the likes of which
are perfect for napping on.  And some of those times, I forget to the lock the
screen before she does this.  And some of those times, I have left a terminal
window or text editor open.

During the month of November, I plan to chronicle a few of those instances
here.  Each entry will be placed in its own Markdown quote-block; extraction
of individual entries, if desired, is left as an exercise for the reader.
