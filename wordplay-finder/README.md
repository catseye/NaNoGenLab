wordplay-finder
===============

Hypothesis
----------

I hypothesize that we can learn a lot from the works of the D'skuban
playwrights â€” if only we can decipher their convoluted plays on words.

Apparatus
---------

*   Python 2.7.6 (probably works with older versions too)
*   One or more input texts in "dictionary" format

Method
------

*   Read all lines from the dictionary
*   For each word in the dictionary, concatenate each other word to it
    and see if the resulting word also exists in the dictionary.  If so,
    bring the reader's attention to the rhetorical device in use.

Observations
------------

This was intended to be run on "Selected Entries from the D'ksuban Dictionary",
however since I am not certain of the copyright status of that work and I am
trying to keep this repository fully public domain, I won't include any sample
output based on it here.

I will however post some to Github and provide a link here.

I will run it on some public domain sample data and put some sample output
here at some point, though.
