NaNoGenLab
==========

Herein may be found novel-generation experiments for [NaNoGenMo 2014][]
(and possibly beyond) conducted under the auspices of [Cat's Eye Technologies][].

Should an experiment turn out wildly successful, it may be deemed to warrant
its own repository; in this case, it will probably be kicked out of this nest.

Note that the word "experiment", like the word "novel", may mean many things.

Everything in this repository is in the public domain; see the file
UNLICENSE in the root directory for more information.
