Herein may be found novel-generation experiments for [NaNoGenMo 2014][]
conducted under the auspices of [Cat's Eye Technologies][].

Note that the word "experiment", like the word "novel", may mean many things.

An experiment a day during November
-----------------------------------

Having not come up with a really ripping idea for a novel to generate,
I [decided][] fairly early on in November to make my goal for this NaNoGenMo
to run one little experiment per day (on average) in the generation,
transformation, and general mutilation of text (and images, yes those too.
See the link for more details.)

In roughly chronicological order (based on when they were started, not when
they were finished), the experiments have been:

1. join-at-pivot
2. levenshtein-equidistant
3. infix-neologisms
4. pyramidal-reduction
5. checkerboard-layout
6. narrative-makefile
7. eliza-vs-eliza
8. naive-cut-up
9. poetic-inventory
10. wikimedia-illustrations
11. evaporating-text
12. shanty-generator
13. reluctance-generator
14. columnar-cthulhuian
15. ending-concordance
16. find-cut-up-regions
17. levenshtein-pathway
18. selfref-timeline
19. perm-count-finder
20. uniquified-novel
21. binary-phone-words
22. recursive-template
23. infinite-grammar
24. quick-and-dirty-markov
25. wordplay-finder
26. levenshtein-word-replacement
27. sensible-paste-up*
28. joke-o-matic
29. levenshtein-swapper
30. advanced-spoonerizer

A * indicates that they could still use a bit of work before I'm entirely
happy with them.

Anything not listed there is either a piece of lab equipment, a collection
of materials, or just wasn't deemed to be experimental enough to be an
experiment.  Some of these are:

* generic-corpora (materials)
* fetch-chronam (lab equipment)
* image-calipers (lab equipment)
* narrow-cut-up (not different enough from naive-cut-up)
* naive-spoonerizer (not different enough from advanced-spoonerizer)
