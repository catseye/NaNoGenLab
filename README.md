NaNoGenLab
==========

Herein may be found novel-generation experiments for [NaNoGenMo 2014][]
(and possibly beyond) conducted under the auspices of [Cat's Eye Technologies][].

Should an experiment turn out wildly successful, it may be deemed to warrant
its own repository; in this case, it will probably be kicked out of this nest.

Note that the word "experiment", like the word "novel", may mean many things.
