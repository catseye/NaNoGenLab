joke-o-matic
============

Hypothesis
----------

I hypothesize that computers have no sense of humour, but nevertheless
they can be quite funny.  Or at least, they make me laugh.

Apparatus
---------

*   Python 2.7.6 (probably works with older versions too)

Method
------

*   Emulate the great comedians.

Observations
------------

_OMG so awful._

> A cowboy, a priest, and a cat walk into a bar.
> 
> The cowboy says to the bartender, "I'll have a whiskey and soda."
> 
> The bartender says, "Aren't you a cowboy?"
> 
> The priest says, "Yes, but don't tell the cat!"

or maybe you'd prefer

> A cat, a surfer, and a programmer walk into a bar.
> 
> The surfer says to the bartender, "Have you got a light?"
> 
> The bartender says, "Aren't you a surfer?"
> 
> The surfer says, "That's what the programmer said!"
