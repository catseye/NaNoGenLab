checkerboard-layout
===================

Hypothesis
----------

We hypothesize that if we remove the spaces from between the words of a text,
that text can still be read as long as each word has alternating contrast.

Apparatus
---------

*   Python 2.7.6 (probably works with older versions too)
*   An input text
*   A modern web browser (to see the result)

Method
------

*   Display each alternating word in an alternating colour (black or white)
    on an alternating background colour (white or black.)

Observations
------------

Here is a screenshot of Firefox 33.0 displaying something by Lord Dunsany
that was passed through this script:
