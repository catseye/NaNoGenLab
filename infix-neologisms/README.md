infix-neologisms
================

Hypothesis
----------

We hypothesize that new words can be formed from existing words by splitting
them open and sticking a word inside.

Apparatus
---------

*   Python 2.7.6 (probably works with older versions too)
*   A set of input words

Method
------

*   Pick an input word.
*   Split it into two parts.  Pick another input word and insert it in
    the middle.
*   Possibly repeat step #2.
*   Output the word and repeat from step #1.

Observations
------------

Running it on `../generic-corpora/containers.txt` which I just threw together
after a few internet searches, you might get
